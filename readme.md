## About Me

<br>
Experienced and collaboration focused leader, has worked in the startup world for many years and successfully grew a company from ~$400k in revenues to over 8MM over 5 years. I’m quick to learn new things and have worn a lot of hats in my time. I’m in the process of a career change because I have a deep passion for technology and before I got into people management I was working toward a technical role but business needs at the time pushed me in another direction. Now that I’ve had success with my previous endeavors and exited my previous company, I’m redirecting my work ethic to focus on completing a competitive Software Engineering Immersive that is teaching me how to create dynamic applications through the use of Javascript, CSS, HTML, Node and React in an agile based environment.

<!-- #### Note about social media

* I am not active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok. Social media has been a wonderful invention but over the past decade the major providers of these services have been manipulated to be primarily profit generating systems with irresponsible leadership as opposed to being something decentralized that brings human beings together. As a result, I am personally opposed to using the established social networks and would rather support emerging social media companies that understand the social responsibility that comes with running an interconnected social network.  -->
